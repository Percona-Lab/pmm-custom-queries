multi_source_repl:
  query: "SELECT service_state, COUNT(service_state) AS service_state_count FROM performance_schema.replication_connection_status GROUP BY service_state;"
  metrics:
    - service_state:
        usage: "LABEL"
        description: "Replication thread state name"
    - service_state_count:
        usage: "COUNTER"
        description: "Count by service state name"
multi_source_repl_delay:
  query: "SELECT channel_name, Sql_delay, Number_of_workers FROM mysql.slave_relay_log_info;"
  metrics:
    - channel_name:
        usage: "LABEL"
        description: "Replication channel name"
    - Sql_delay:
        usage: "COUNTER"
        description: "SQL Thread delay in seconds"
    - Number_of_workers:
        usage: "COUNTER"
        description: "Parallel replication workers count for this channel"
